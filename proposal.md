# Project Overview

## 1. What are you trying to do?
We are collaborating with Fetal Life, a company dedicated to creating a machine learning-driven solution designed to assist pregnant women. Our goal is to assist pregnant women in managing their health at home with personalized care and advanced technology. We are addressing the needs of pregnant women who face the risk of developing gestational diabetes during their pregnancy. This condition can lead to complications for both the mother and the baby, such as high blood pressure, challenging childbirth, low blood sugar in babies, and long-term risks like obesity and type 2 diabetes. Our solution focuses on early prediction and prevention of gestational diabetes, identifying at-risk pregnant women and providing proactive care to mitigate these risks.

## 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes occurs around the 20th week of pregnancy. Unfortunately, by this point, the condition is already confirmed, with limited options for intervention. This method lacks early intervention and prevention capabilities.

## 3. What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?
Our innovative approach leverages ML technology to assess multiple parameters, such as age, socioeconomic status, health history, and Medicaid claims data, to identify high-risk pregnant women. We believe this novel approach, along with indicators like early weight gain, will facilitate early intervention, significantly improving success rates in preventing gestational diabetes.

## 4. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
The stakeholders include both pregnant women and Fetal Life. Success in this project will lead to improved health outcomes for mothers and their babies, reducing the risks associated with gestational diabetes and enhancing overall well-being.

## 5. What are the risks?
Potential risks involve data privacy and ethical considerations in handling sensitive health information. Additionally, there may be challenges in the accuracy of ML predictions and the willingness of healthcare systems to adapt to this new approach.

# Project Execution

## 6. Data Acquisition
We are identifying suitable datasets on platforms like Kaggle, NIH OR CMS websites that meet our criteria.

## Weekly Project Timeline

# Coordination Plan

The team will engage in weekly meetings to discuss progress, address challenges, and ensure alignment in tasks. Members will work in parallel, each focusing on different machine learning approaches. This collaborative and competitive approach ensures that multiple strategies are explored simultaneously, accelerating the discovery of the best solution. It also guarantees that the project remains on track and adheres to the stipulated timeline.
